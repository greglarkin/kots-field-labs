Lab 1.4: Preflight Checks
=========================================


- no kots installed
- Add config.txt and secretfile.txt as preflight checks
- then do a kots install
- how to force reset with kots remove, guidance on this


Now that we've found a number of things that can go wrong and built support analyzers to understand them,
we'll convert what we've learned into preflight checks. 
Preflight checks enable application packagers to inform end users of misconfigured environments *before* the application is launched.
